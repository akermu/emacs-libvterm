[![MELPA](https://melpa.org/packages/vterm-badge.svg)](https://melpa.org/#/vterm)

# Introduction

This emacs module implements a bridge to
[libvterm](https://github.com/neovim/libvterm) to display a terminal in an Emacs
buffer.

## Warning

This is an **alpha release**, so it will crash your Emacs. If it does, please
[report a bug](https://github.com/akermu/emacs-libvterm/issues/new)!

# Installation

## Manual

Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/akermu/emacs-libvterm.git
```

Before installing emacs-libvterm, you need to make sure you have
installed
 1. Emacs with [module
    support](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Dynamic-Modules.html).
    You can check that, by verifying that `module-file-suffix` is not `nil`.
 2. cmake (>=3.11)
 3. libtool-bin (related issues:
    [#66](https://github.com/akermu/emacs-libvterm/issues/66)
    [#85](https://github.com/akermu/emacs-libvterm/issues/85#issuecomment-491845136))
 4. If you compile vterm with `-DUSE_SYSTEM_LIBVTERM` make sure you have the
    library from https://github.com/neovim/libvterm

Run the build:

``` sh
mkdir -p build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

And add this to your `init.el`:

``` elisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "path/to/emacs-libvterm")
(require 'vterm)
```

Or, with `use-package`:

```elisp
(use-package vterm
  :load-path  "path/to/emacs-libvterm/"
)
```

## From MELPA

`vterm` is available on [MELPA](https://melpa.org/), and it can be installed as
a normal package. If the requirements are satisfied (mainly, Emacs was built
with support for modules), `vterm` will take care of the compilation of all its
components.

`vterm` can be install with MELPA with `use-package` by adding the following
lines to your `init.el`:

```elisp
(use-package vterm
    :ensure t
)
```

# Debugging and testing

If you have successfully built the module, you can test it by executing the
following command in the `build` directory:

```sh
make run
```

# Usage

## `vterm`

Open a terminal in the current window.

## `vterm-other-window`

Open a terminal in another window.

## `vterm-copy-mode`

When you enable `vterm-copy-mode`, the terminal buffer behaves like a normal
`read-only` text buffer: you can search, copy text, etc. The default keybinding
to toggle `vterm-copy-mode` is `C-c C-t`. When a region is selected, it is
possible to copy the text and leave `vterm-copy-mode` with the enter key.

## `vterm-clear-scrollback`

`vterm-clear-scrollback` does exactly what the name suggests: it clears the
current buffer from the data that it is not currently visible.
`vterm-clear-scrollback` is bound to `C-c C-l`. This function is typically used
with the `clear` function provided by the shell to clear both screen and
scrollback. In order to achieve this behavior, you need to add a new shell alias.

For `zsh`, put this in your `.zshrc`:
```zsh
if [[ "$INSIDE_EMACS" = 'vterm' ]]; then
    alias clear='printf "\e]51;Evterm-clear-scrollback\e\\";tput clear'
fi
```
For `bash`, put this in your `.bashrc`:
```bash
if [[ "$INSIDE_EMACS" = 'vterm' ]]; then
    function clear(){
        printf  "\e]51;Evterm-clear-scrollback\e\\";
        tput clear;
    }
fi
```

These aliases take advantage of the fact that `vterm` can execute `elisp`
commands, as explained below.

# Customization

## `vterm-shell`

Shell to run in a new vterm. It defaults to `$SHELL`.

## `vterm-term-environment-variable`

Value for the `TERM` environment variable. It defaults to `xterm-256color`. If
[eterm-256color](https://github.com/dieggsy/eterm-256color) is installed,
setting `vterm-term-environment-variable` to `eterm-color` improves the
rendering of colors in some systems.

## Keybindings

If you want a key to be sent to the terminal, bind it to `vterm--self-insert`,
or remove it from `vterm-mode-map`. By default, `vterm.el` binds most of the
`C-<char>` and `M-<char>` keys, `<f1>` through `<f12>` and some special keys
like `<backspace>` and `<return>`. Sending a keyboard interrupt is bound to `C-c
C-c`.

## Colors

Set the `:foreground` and `:background` attributes of the following faces to a
color you like. The `:foreground` is ansi color 0-7, the `:background` attribute
is ansi color 8-15.

- vterm-color-default
- vterm-color-black
- vterm-color-red
- vterm-color-green
- vterm-color-yellow
- vterm-color-blue
- vterm-color-magenta
- vterm-color-cyan
- vterm-color-white

## Shell Integration & Directory tracking

Vterm Shell Integration feature is made possible by proprietary escape sequences.
The goal of the proprietary escape sequences is to mark up a shell's output
with semantic information about where the prompt begins and ends, where
the user-entered command begins and ends.

`vterm` supports _directory tracking_. If this feature is enabled, the default
directory in Emacs and the current working directory in `vterm` are synced. As a
result, interactive functions that ask for a path or a file (e.g., `dired` or
`find-file`) will do so starting from the current location.

Directory tracking requires some configuration, as the shell has to be instructed
to share the revelant information with Emacs.

For `zsh`, put this at the end of your `.zshrc`:

```zsh
vterm_prompt_begin() {
   printf "\e]51;C\e\\"
}
vterm_prompt_end() {
    printf "\e]51;A$(whoami)@$(hostname):$(pwd)\e\\";
}
PROMPT='%{$(vterm_prompt_begin)%}'$PROMPT'%{$(vterm_prompt_end)%}'

autoload -U add-zsh-hook
add-zsh-hook -Uz preexec(){printf "\e]51;B\e\\";}
```

For `bash`, put this at the end of your `.bashrc`:
Please install  [bash-preexec](https://github.com/rcaloras/bash-preexec)

```bash
vterm_prompt_begin(){
  printf "\e]51;C\e\\"
}
vterm_prompt_end(){
    printf "\e]51;A$(whoami)@$(hostname):$(pwd)\e\\"
}
PS1='$(vterm_prompt_begin)'$PS1'$(vterm_prompt_end)'

test -e "${HOME}/.bash-preexec.sh" && source "${HOME}/.bash-preexec.sh"
preexec() { printf "\e]51;B\e\\"; }
```

For `fish`, put this in your `~/.config/fish/config.fish`:

```fish
function vterm_cmd_end --on-event fish_preexec; printf "\e]51;B\e\\"; end

function vterm_prompt_begin;
    printf "\e]51;C\e\\";
end

function vterm_prompt_end;
    printf '\e]51;A'(whoami)'@'(hostname)':'(pwd)'\e\\';
end


functions -c fish_mode_prompt vterm_old_fish_mode_prompt
function fish_mode_prompt --description 'Write out the prompt; do not replace this. Instead, put this at end of your file.'
    vterm_prompt_begin
    vterm_old_fish_mode_prompt
end

functions -c fish_prompt vterm_old_fish_prompt
function fish_prompt --description 'Write out the prompt; do not replace this. Instead, put this at end of your file.'
    # Remove the trailing newline from the original prompt. This is done
    # using the string builtin from fish, but to make sure any escape codes
    # are correctly interpreted, use %b for printf.
    printf "%b" (string join "\n" (vterm_old_fish_prompt))
    vterm_prompt_end
end
```

Directory tracking works on remote servers too. In case the hostname of your
remote machine does not match the actual hostname needed to connect to that
server, change `$(hostname)` with the correct one.

## Message passing

`vterm` can read and execute commands. At the moment, a command is
passed by providing a specific escape sequence. For example, to evaluate
``` elisp
(message "Hello!")
```
use
``` sh
printf "\e]51;Emessage \"Hello\!\"\e\\"
```

The commands that are understood are defined in the setting `vterm-eval-cmds`.

As `split-string-and-unquote` is used the parse the passed string, double quotes
and backslashes need to be escaped via backslash. For instance, bash can replace
strings internally.

```sh
vterm_cmd() {
    printf "\e]51;E"
    local r
    while [[ $# -gt 0 ]]; do
        r="${1//\\/\\\\}"
        r="${r//\"/\\\"}"
        printf '"%s" ' "$r"
        shift
    done
    printf "\e\\"
}
```

However if you are using dash and need a pure POSIX implementation:

```sh
vterm_cmd() {
    printf "\e]51;E"
    while [ $# -gt 0 ]; do
        printf '"%s" ' "$(printf "%s" "$1" | sed -e 's|\\|\\\\|g' -e 's|"|\\"|g')"
        shift
    done
    printf "\e\\"
}
```

Now we can write shell functions to call the ones defined in `vterm-eval-cmds`.

```sh
find_file() {
    vterm_cmd find-file "$(realpath "$@")"
}

say() {
    vterm_cmd message "%s" "$*"
}
```

This can be used inside `vterm` as

```sh
find_file name_of_file_in_local_directory
```

As an example, say you like having files opened below the current window. You
could add the command to do it on the lisp side like so:

``` elisp
(push (list "find-file-below"
            (lambda (path)
              (if-let* ((buf (find-file-noselect path))
                        (window (display-buffer-below-selected buf nil)))
                  (select-window window)
                (message "Failed to open file: %s" path))))
      vterm-eval-cmds)
```

Then add the command in your `.bashrc` file.

```sh
open_file_below() {
    vterm_cmd find-file-below "$(realpath "$@")"
}
```

Then you can open any file from inside your shell.

```sh
open_file_below ~/Documents
```
